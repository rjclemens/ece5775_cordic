# @brief: A makefile the compiles and runs the cordic program
#
# @desc: 1. "make float" compiles & executes the floating-point implementation
#        2. "make fixed" compiles & executes the fixed-point implementation
#        3. "make clean" cleans up the directory

# Extract Vivado HLS include path
